Fuzzy Functional System
=======================
Functional Fuzzy System (ffs) is intended to be a very simple library for modeling fuzzy system for
Mamdani and Sugeno inference.

.. note::
I use this simple library for R&D fuzzy control and process simulation based on Python.
I'm used to working with fuzzy tolboxes from Matlab and Scilab(sciFLT) so i tried to keep similar convention.
